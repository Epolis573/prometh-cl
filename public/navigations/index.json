All of the tech in Prometheus’s CO2-to-fuels process is powered only by renewable electricity, which is why we call our zero net carbon fuel “electric fuel.”\n\nThe only inputs to our process are air and renewable power. The only outputs are fuel and oxygen. There are no agricultural inputs and no waste products. And there is no limit to the scale at which CO2 can be converted into fuels. It is possible to completely replace the global use of fossil oil and gas with our zero net carbon fuels. By doing this, we can lower annual CO2 emissions by more than 20 gigatons per year, half of all emissions today. By using CO2 to make carbon negative objects—or as we call them, “banked-carbon goods”—we can remove historical CO2 emissions, storing them in useful products forever. This is how we can solve the climate crisis."

        "value": "The pivotal moment that created Prometheus came in October of 2018 after two landmark events. The first was when the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change released a dire report. In a list of scenes, it laid out, in graphic detail, the staggering destruction the world was all but certain to suffer in just a few short years. There was still time, the report said, to stop climate change and avoid the worst impacts. But only if the world took immediate, radical steps, not just to curb new emissions, but to remove CO2 from the air.\n\nHeeding this call, two weeks later, Y Combinator, the acclaimed Silicon Valley accelerator, put out a request: any founder with an idea for how to remove that CO2 from the air should step forward. “It’s time to take big swings at this,” it said.\n\nWe knew we had to act. That winter, Prometheus was accepted to Y Combinator and launched on Demo Day the following March. Before a packed auditorium, Prometheus founder and CEO, Rob McGinnis explained how the company could pull CO2 from the air and turn it into jet fuel, diesel, and gasoline that were atomically identical to their fossil counterparts. Not only would Prometheus’s fuels be 100% carbon neutral, their production could be scaled in time to save the Earth."

To do and be less.\n\nWe, at Prometheus, think this would be a terrible mistake. We believe we can meet this epic challenge not in spite of, but because of who we are.\n\nThe urge to discover what lies beyond that far horizon, or that ocean, or this planet, is part of what makes us human. We are explorers and adventurers. We search for inspiration, for what’s new and what’s next. And we yearn to live better, larger lives. Throughout human existence, this restless impulse has led our species to overcome near unfathomable hardships. And it’s exactly this ability that we need now.\n\nWe shouldn’t shrink the scope of human experience. Instead, our goal should be to break the historical link between energy and the dirty fossil fuels that are destroying our world. Instead, we should make energy and the things we do with it in a brand new way.\n\nThis is our mission at Prometheus. We are propelled by the future we imagine—one in which everyone who wants to can experience the joy of a road trip, the thrill of flight, and, one day soon, the humbling awe of viewing the Earth from orbit."
